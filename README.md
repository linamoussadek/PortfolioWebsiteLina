# Personal Portfolio Website - CSI3140 Project

See the rest of Owen's individual commit history at : https://github.com/OHalvorson77/portfolio. The code was combined into one respository about halfway through the work of Owen's portfolio.

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the personal portfolio websites of Owen and Lina, developed as a part of Assignment 1 for group 13 in the course CSI3140 at the University of Ottawa. 
The purpose of this project is to create individual portfolio websites showcasing each member's skills, projects, and resume. 
Each portfolio includes an "About Me" section, a resume, a list of projects, and more. 
There is also a reciprocal link to each other’s portfolio for easy navigation between the two.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Features for each portfolio
- **About Me Section:** Serves as an introduction, detailing professional backgrounds and interests.
- **Resume:** Displays educational qualifications, experiences, skills, and other relevant details.
- **Projects:** Lists the projects undertaken or contributed to, with summaries and highlights of each.
- **Navigation Links:** Each portfolio page includes a link to the other person's portfolio, enhancing connectivity and user experience.
